# Scripts

A unstructured collection of scripts to explore or patch data. Can be used to
fix production data, to do some cold analysis, or to test some piece of code.

## Usage

Assuming you've sourced the required environment variables (mostly the database connector), you can launch a given script with `mix run`:

```
mix run scripts/my-script.exs
```
