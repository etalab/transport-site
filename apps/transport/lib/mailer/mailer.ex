  @moduledoc """
  A mailer built on top of Swoosh, see documentation here https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh/Swoosh.html
  The main Swoosh package provides most functionality (including dev preview and test functionality).
  Phoenix.Swoosh just adds the ability to render views and templates https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_swoosh/readme.html
  You need to have a module that actually generates mails, either just importing Swoosh.Email if you donâ€™t need templates, either using Phoenix.Swoosh if you do, and then the emails are passed to this module to be actually sent.
  For now it uses Mailjet as a provider (see config/config.exs), but it could be changed to another provider if needed.

  Testing currently relies on https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh/Swoosh.Adapters.Test.html, which provides
  basic global mode (https://github.com/swoosh/swoosh/pull/565/files). If this turn out not to be enough,
  this module `Transport.Mailer` will have to be Mox'ed instead.
