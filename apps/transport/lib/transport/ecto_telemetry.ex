  @moduledoc """
  A module receiving Ecto events and forwarding them (currently) to AppSignal, so that we can
  chart the pool occupancy.

  Reference: https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html#module-telemetry-events

  Inspiration: https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/issues/318#issuecomment-841156779

  A few notes extracted from the doc (with extra comments):
  * :idle_time - the time the connection spent waiting before being checked out for the query. 
                 the higher the better ; if this gets low (close to 0), the pool is over-used (not good).
  * :queue_time - the time spent waiting to check out a database connection.
                  the lower the better. if this gets too high, the pool is over-used (not good).
  * :query_time - the time spent executing the query.

  We do not track the following metrics for now, because they are less useful for pool optimization:
  * :decode_time - the time spent decoding the data received from the database
  * :total_time - the sum of (queue_time, query_time, and decode_time)️

    # Only requests and logging. Custom metrics are included.".
    #
    # If we need to reduce the volume of metrics (for billing or ops reasons), it appears that
    # Oban emits roughly 5 calls every 500ms in development at least (setting WORKER=0) removes those events.
    # If this is a problem, we can probably filter a part of them via metadata[:options][:oban_conf] which
    # appears to be there, but for now I believe this gives useful information too.
