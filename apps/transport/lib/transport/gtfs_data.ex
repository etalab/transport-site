defmodule Transport.GTFSData do
  @moduledoc """
  A module centralizing data functions for GTFS (stops for now).

  Here is the general explanation around the algorithms used to create the national GTFS stops map,
  centralized in one place for simplicity.

  The client side (`gtfs.js`) computes the width/height in pixels and the bounding box (north/south/east/west).
  The size in pixels is useful to try to display similarly spaced clusters, as explained below.

  Server-side, `explore_controller.ex` counts the stops in the bounding box.

  Under a certain threshold, one that allows decent performance on the client side & in delay in transmission from
  the server to the client, a non-aggregate (aka "detailed") reply is generated as GeoJSON, allowing to show per-stop
  detailed information.

  Above the threshold, aggregates are returned to the client instead. The controller computes "snap x" and "snap y"
  values, which are the delta in latitude/longitude, divided per 5 pixels of screen, based on what is sent by the client.

  This is done to give the controller enough information to figure out how to display roughly equally spaced/sized "cells" on the screen,
  all while keeping the number of overall clusters for a given zoom level low enough.

  To save bandwidth and get a fast-enough experience, the aggregates are returned as [count, lat, lon] JSON arrays,
  without any key, and with reduced decimal precision.

  The aggregates are pre-computed as materialized views for each of the 12 zoom levels encountered with leaflet.
  For each zoom level, the stops are counted as aggregates via `ST_SnapToGrid`. The delta latitude/longitude for each zoom level
  has been captured from the client and hardcoded (see `@zoom_levels`).

  When an actual aggregate query needs to occur, the snap_x/snap_y computed values (thanks to what is sent by the client)
  are used to determine which zoom level is the closest in term of snap_y, which helps deciding which aggregate to pick.

  # To recreate these values, you must compute, for each Leaflet zoom-level,

  #
  # (east - west) / (width_in_pixels / 5.0)
  # (north - south) / (height_in_pixels / 5.0)
  #
  # This can be achieved for instance purely in `gtfs.js` with the following code
  # in the `moveend` event:
  #
  # ```
  #    console.log(map.getZoom())
  #    console.log((bounds.getEast() - bounds.getWest()) / (widthPixels / 5.0))
  #    console.log((bounds.getNorth() - bounds.getSouth()) / (heightPixels / 5.0))

  # the computations on an average sized screen. They will also vary based on where
  # you zoom, so I worked mostly around Metropolitan France.
