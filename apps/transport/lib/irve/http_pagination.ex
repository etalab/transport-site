  Although namespaced under IRVE for simplicity, this is more data-gouv specific.

  This provides a paginating strategy based on the idea of generating all paginated
  urls at once, based on the first page response, instead of waiting for each link.

  Works at the moment, could need more work if data gouv changes of behaviour
  in the future though.

  @doc """
  Using a base url and an http client, generates a stream of pages urls using
  a naive algorithm to build all urls upfront instead of having to wait for each
  page before getting the other pages.

  This will only work for some cases (e.g. datagouv).

  Current implementation assumes fixed field names and a decoded (JSON, typically) response,
  but is already partially generic.
