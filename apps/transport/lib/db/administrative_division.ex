defmodule DB.AdministrativeDivision do

  AdministrativeDivision schema, in French "CollectivitÃ© Territoriale".
  This schema is used to represent the territorial divisions in France: communes, EPCI, departments and regions.
  The schema for now doesnâ€™t show relationships between territorial divisions, such as the relationship between a commune and its EPCI or department.
  (But this relationship is available in the Commune schema, for example.)
  It relies on a single table in the database, administrative_division.
  The data is replicated (denormalized) from the dedicated commune, epci, departement and region tables.
  This is done to simplify the queries and the data model for some use cases: search, link to dataset, etc.
  Other approaches were considered, such as using a materialized view, the existing separate tables,
  but they all had drawbacks. For example, a materialized view would not allow us to use foreign keys, which is important for data integrity.
