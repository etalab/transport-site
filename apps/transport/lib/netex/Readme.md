## Extraction of stop places from a streamed NeTEx

A modest collection of helpers to extract stop places from a NeTEx archive. It
is notably useful to build the "Registre d'arrÃªts".

## Validation of French profile via enRoute Chouette Valid

We depend on enRoute Chouette Valid for NeTEx validation. Chouette Valid is a
SaaS.

It is extensible: one can define its own set of validation rules. This section
is therefore responsible of translating a subset of the rules from the [French
profile] to the rules model of Chouette Valid, and synchronizing it via
their API.
