defmodule Transport.NeTEx.StopPlacesStreamingParser do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is a `Saxy` streaming XML parser, able to scan very large XML files
  in a way that does not overload the memory (element by element).

  It is a first stab at reading NeTEx files to pick `StopPlace`s.

  Limitations:
  - There are other locations in a NeTEx file where to find stops, and also other concepts (`Quay`),
    but this is already providing a first basis on which we'll iterate.
  - The result is an accumulated array (not a stream), which is not actually a problem given the
    current size of the output, but this could be changed in the future.
  - The scanning structure is hard-coded, and we will want later to use something more flexible
    (Ã  la XPath), maybe via macros or real XPath calls, but this is good enough for now.

  How it works:
  - Detect `StopPlace` elements
  - Extract their `id` attribute
  - Underneath, find the `Centroid/Location/[Latitude|Longitude]` nodes

  Some `StopPlace`s do not have any `Centroid` nor `Latitude|Longitude`, but are still scanned.
